RsyncOSX

The repository is source code for the macOS application RsyncOSX. The application is implemented in Swift 3.0 by using Xcode version 8.x. The application is not depended upon any third party binary distributions. There is, however, a third party source code included to check for TCP connections. The check is for informal use only and can be removed. All other code is stock use of Swift 3.0 and libraries as part of Xcode version 8.x. To compile the code, install Xcode, open the RsyncOSX project file and compile.
